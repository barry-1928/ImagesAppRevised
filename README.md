# ImagesAppRevised

This App is developed having an objective of storing images by either capturing images using Camers App or by picking images from Gallery App
of your phone. The "Add Image" and the "App Details" option have been given on the Action Bar. Option to delete an image or cropping it are also
provided, which can be accessed on long clicking the item that you want to apply the settings on. 
The app uses Shared Preferences to store the image paths which are retrieved later by getting the uri from it.


Thank You.
